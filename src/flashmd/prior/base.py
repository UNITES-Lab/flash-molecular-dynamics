    Priors are torch.nn.Module objects that should represent an energy term that has
    a traditional functional form, like a harmonic potential or a fourier series.

    They should called as functions with AtomicData objects as parameters and then
    they should populate their `.out` field with their energy, similar to how
    SchNet modules do this.

    The different parameters needed for different beads in this interactions should
    be stored in `torch.nn.parameter.Buffer` objects to avoid any backwards passes
    over this parameters.
